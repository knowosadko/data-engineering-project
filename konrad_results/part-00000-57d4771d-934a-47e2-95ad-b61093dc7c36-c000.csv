dnqik1n,"I think that's a bug, personally from a lot of campaign and a bit of custom battles night runners don't feel like a replacement for slingers.

Slingers feel far more useful for harassing units around your army and getting in that morale damage.(Some Skaven clan rats and a unit of slingers can make Kroxigores route with a good surround and focus fire, especially with a spell in the middle of them or sniping the lord.)

While Nightrunners are better at dedicated skirmishers, harass arches with them, force the enemy to draw units away and pepper them, and once they're out of ammo just use them to flank for your clan rats and break units.

I haven't really tried out the more expensive variants of the night runners, but I imagine they play the same but just a bit more annoying.

So, vs AI you can break up their army and possibly even pull half of it away with just a few nightrunners while constantly plinking at their health. Vs players they seem like an annoyance and way to distract/take away some of their micro or punish them if they're not paying attention.",3,-0.9312

You'd get Mind Controller to onyx(!) by the end if you kept up that pace fielding for 19 hours, and if you do it in the right spot (or just put in one last field at the end) you could pretty easily get Illuminator too. You'd *just* get Connector platinum by the end of it, and could get Recruiter platinum with virtually no effort on your part if it's prepped in advance.

The 3 extra golds is where things start to break down a bit. Spec Ops is pretty easy, but you'd need to have a lot of easy 4 portal missions in the same area to do it and still have time for your last two. Translator gold is doable in that timeframe, but would take up a majority of that time and leave you one gold short. I expect Spec Ops/Pioneer/Explorer would be the best combo, since doing Pioneer would inherently get you half-way to Explorer. It's plausible that Spec Ops/Pioneer/Recharger might be faster with some good key management, but with how temperamental Niantic is for recharging I'd rather just go for the thousand additional unique hacks.

dnqik8c,"&gt; This makes no logical, rhetorical, or grammatical sense

Yes it does, because when you say the reasoning behind the action is fair but the action as taken is not you're defending the intent to take action, not the specific action itself. In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.

&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape

On some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said \"so and so got raped by her ex\" and someone replied \"well she did screw him over hard in the divorce\". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.

When people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.

&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions

I have used British Columbia plates in Washington and California, and successfully evaded the tolls because while my license plate was scanned, no agreement was in place to actually track me down and bill me. Same for using California plates in Ontario, Canada.

Toll collection authorities will only track down out-of-state plates that they expect to show up frequently. For example, New York is often visited by drivers from Ontario and Massachusetts, so if you're from those places and try to use NY tolled roads without an EZPass you will get nailed. Likewise, Ontario will track drivers from Quebec, Michigan, and NY for sure. But if your car is registered in California, then it's highly unlikely that they'll bother to track you down. It costs them money to do so, and California-plated cars are a rare sight in that region.",2,0.34

dnqik92,"As for the name? I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.

I love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.

I understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.

If my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.

If you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.

Here's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.

Quick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.",4,0.1672

dnqikdp,"&gt;Elaborate, please. Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.

You stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. 

If you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. 

&gt;I‚Äôve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people‚Äôs mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.

I made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was \"figurative\". 

Say what you mean and you won't have all of these \"internet warriors\" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. 

&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.

OK.

You said. 

&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.


Then you stated what that meant was:

&gt; I didn‚Äôt mean, ‚Äúleave right now and never look back‚Äù. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.


To which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. 

So first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. 

As an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is \"premises\", not \"premise\". THE MORE YOU KNOW ÂΩ°‚òÜ",1,-0.6775

dnqikes,"I'm super picky about screens, and I don't think it really matters. There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.

If you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.

Incidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)

Two good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: 

* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.

* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.

There is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.

I wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered.",3,0.9948

dnqikf7,"I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. 

After all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap.

dnqikg9,"&gt;No, you're playing word games. Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.

That's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.

&gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.

OK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation. 

&gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.

Ah, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.

For slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present. And this means that the slaver necessarily worsens the slave's situation to make them choose to work!",0,-0.9962

dnqikh0,"&gt;That doesn't logic right. There may be 1000 types of Christianity but none of them are related to whether Christianity is \"correct,\" again, whatever that means. 

Sure it does. If we take that Christianity is the correct religion ( instead of atheism or *insert a list of all other deistic ideology here*) then any given Christian has a 1 in 1000 shot at interpreting the dogma in the correct way as to not be a blasphemous hell bound sinner. 

&gt;What does it mean to be correct 

In this case it means that of all available options, both past and present, you successfully chose the one that ends up being true. 

&gt;and furthermore, what does a sect of Christianity not practicing Christianity correctly mean to whether Christianity is correct? 

Nothing. That's why I said that if we accept the **premise** that Christianity is correct, it still only gives any single practioner a one in 1000 shot at being right. It does not bear on wether or not Christians are right, that number was too astronomical to calculate.",1,0.9674

dnqikhe,"Maybe it has to do with the fact that being a reservist sucks shit these days.

I left a while ago, but comparing what we got to do, compared to what the militia got to do in the 1980's, it is why no wonder why no one wants to stay in anymore.

Guys I know that were in in the 80's talk about thousands of reservists being on exercises in the summer and thousands on exercise in the winter. M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.

Compared to now. 
Maybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.

That same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.


That and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.


Reservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay?

dnqikl6,"LIS had me enjoying Chloe as a character but irritated in some respects. BTS has made her my favourite character and justified plenty for why she is the way she is in LIS. 


I'm looking forward and not looking forward to finding out how Rachel ends up with Frank. Chloe considers her a close connection and inevitably at some point, a lover, otherwise she wouldn't have flipped out when you find out the relationship of Rachel and Frank. 


Rachel's someone I think who enjoys playing with people to a degree and is almost certainly a liar, yet is the thing with Frank because of something that happens, or are the feelings genuine, and what possesses her to betray Chloe? Or was it all misinterpreted by Frank or mis-sold as something more serious than it really was. Hard to say. 
So many questions. Team Chloe all the way though. 


Hella looking forward to the next episode.

Late afternoon sun tends to be strong so shade lovers like ferns might not be the best bet. The upside of afternoon sun is that it will support a wide variety of colorful plants: annuals like fancy trailing geraniums and sun resistant coleus (Trailing Plum is pretty and dependable http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57816/) in hanging baskets. In pots, you could grow dwarf zinnias, dwarf to mid-height snapdragons, petunias in a zillion colors and patterns, and sun resistant impatience like SunPatiens (http://www.costafarms.com/plants/impatiens-sunpatiens) for color.

Something I tried for the first time this year that was super cute and unusual was dwarf eucomis or pineapple lilies. They grow from spring-planted bulbs in half day sub and look great from June into fall. Very unusual and whimsical.

dnqikpz,"Prior to IP there were trade secrets that protected innovators from competition. Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it. The issue is that IP provides other benefits besides rent seeking to innovators, advantages that aren't talked about.

Imagine modern medicine with trade secrets. There's no way for it to work. How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.

Trade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.

However IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects.",2,0.0827

Generally any money made on reserve usually stays among the council and their families.  I feel sorry for those people.  I used to live in North Western Ontario and man they got the short end of the stick from both the government and their own people who were supposed to be their \"leaders\".

Many weren't allowed to drink on the res so usually once a month when the cheques came in they'd drive to the nearest town that had an LCBO, Beer Store, and Walmart/major grocery store and just clear the places out.  Two things wouldn't be uncommon to see at the local hotels/motels in town at the end of the month A. Pick up trucks full of food/supplies/etc and drunk/passed out natives everywhere.  

Naturally they couldn't get TOO drunk (many of the young ones would) otherwise they ran the risk of someone nosey person who lived in town (in small towns everyone knew everyone even if they lived on the res) to call the council leaders and rat on some poor drunk native kid.  

Add to the fact that they would jack up the prices on all the food/supplies on the res because a lot of times the council leaders were in league with either the airline that would fly the stuff in or the companies that would truck the stuff in and get a cut of the profit from that.

I could be mistaken here, but in the traditional fighting game sense:

1. Tech = \"Throw Tech'ing\" or breaking and/or escaping a throw.  You'll usually hear the word \"throw\" closely associated with the word tech to seperate it from the second definition:

2. Tech = short for \"Technology\" or a method, strategy, or technique for dealing with a particular situation.  It's slang and doesn't really mean anything specifically but you'll hear it used in a phrase such as:

\"Did you see that new reality stone-Spiderman tech?!  You know, the 'tech' where he can keep looping the freeze into web ball over and over again into massive combo damage.\"

Finally, I'm not a Smash/Melee player but I think \"tech\" means something slightly different there where it has more to do with ones ability to do certain (difficult) techniques on the pad.  Usually it follows closely with the second definition above, and contextually it usually make sense, but at times it could mean something slightly different.

It wasn't that I thought hijab is oppressive and backwards. 
It wasn't that I denied that it's an obligation in Islam. 
It wasn't that I wanted to dress in a way that would arouse men. 
It wasn't that I didn't pray and had practically no personal relationship with Allah. 
It wasn't that I had big sins I wasn't ready to let go of yet and felt it would be hypocritical to wear hijab. 
It wasn't that I had no knowledge of Islam. 
It was simply that I was afraid...

Afraid of people's reactions, afraid of being treated differently (I know how they think about Islam and Muslims), afraid of having less chances etc. I *hated* myself for apparently fearing people more than Allah, but it was just extremely difficult for me. I can't really explain how hard it was. It was a form of social anxiety/phobia and it took me years to finally be able to take the step. The tears I dropped in those years could probably fill a pool. The struggle was real, that's all I'm saying. But people don't see that. They just see your public sin and judge you based on that.

This was *my* personal struggle with hijab, but other girls can have different issues with hijab. Or they do wear hijab but have different struggles. Everybody sins, but they sin differently. I know a lot of people struggle with praying on time, porn addiction, masturbation, boyfriends/girlfriends, gambling, drinking, whatever. Some feel guilty about it and others don't.

Consider this code:

If low=0 and high=4 (because there are 5 items in the array), this will set low equal to 1 + whatever **value** is in the middle of the array.  It could be 655, if the input was {0, 11, 655, 765, 888}.  You don't want low=656, you want low=3.

See the difference?

That mistake is in both your recalculation of low and of high.

I kinda like being able to see my surroundings without really having to move my eyes too much (or at all), and am very used to the SQM size of this particular size. I also enjoy having a bigger chat, but that's just a nice bonus, I mainly do it for the screen's size. Too used to it by now, I guess! 

I apologize if it made the video uncomfortable to watch for some of you. Fullscreen should make it much better, but if you're on a phone, it really would suck, so, sorry bout that!

NEVER SOLOQ.The people there are stupid and will waste your time.They don't even know the meta right now which is full of mages,and they keep insisting on playing mm which is just stupid.

Many high elo players play in their teams (say 5 man)but personally I don't.In fact I don't really play with my squad but with other friends from other squads.But in my squad there is a whatsapp group and you can just ask for someone and then play tgt haha.

I don't plan I just play when I feel like playing.

I got it one day before the season ended.Personally i don't recommend gaming so much to 600 because the only good thing u get out of it is \"bragging rights\"/\"self-fulfilment\"but to be honest ..
-Nobody really cares how many stars u have 
-You will never feel happy because there will always be someone higher than you.

I had to spend ALOT of time(luckily it was holidays).I only played hard in the last month of the season.I climbed from 200 to 600 in one month lol.


Advice ermmm....Don't feel nervous if you meet Top squads.Because they are human and they make mistakes in game and can lose sometimes.They have high stars but stars aren't really a good indicator of skill.ive seen 200 star legends beat a 5 man team all above 1k stars so yeah.

Try to go for a trio q with your friends.One of the 3 people must play critical roles in the team like mages or assasin in case pubs can't carry.(most of the time they can't).If you get first pick,do choose what's currently in the meta.When I played trio there was a time I won 30 straight rank games in a row so yea.

Duo is a little more risky in my opinion as there will be 3 heavy people that u have to carry.

5 man is hard since there are a lot of pros who are playing in 5 man teams so personally I stay away from it.But it can be great if your squad has a lot of experience together.

Always try to improve and ask yourself what you could have don't better whenever you die.Maybe your Friend typed \"enemy missing in action\"and you thought meh they may be farming but then u get ganked.

This is a little weird but personally i feel if you play in the wee hours of the morning,that is the most optimal time to raise stars because there are many noobs at that time.It sounds funny but without it I wouldn't be at 600 LOL.

And lastl but not least,don't be addicted to the game.I see many of my friends above 400 stars who play overnight until 7am and then have to go to work.You should know your priorities and not waste your life for a number that means shit.

In the next season I will retire as I feel that I'm too addicted and I have better things to focus on.Aft getting 600 stars I'm abit sick of ranked games haha.
I won't go for it because there are a lot of things to sacrifice to gain it so yea

dnqil2v,"I got depressed in college as well. I was completely overwhelmed and realized way too late that I didn't have a lasting interest in what I was studying. I got counseling and medication (which I also hated) and struggled through. I got a job that I hated, played with my medications to make it through the day and tried to be a good person.

And one day I was done. I didn't want to drug myself to get through life, to even get through a day. Life was more than that. So I quit my job and stopped taking my meds. Found something else I preferred to do and never looked back.

Are you happy with your program that you are in? Are you happy with where you live and the direction your life is heading? Think hard about that. Especially if you can't even study on the weekends. I recall only doing that on weekends because I was so exhausted during the week.

Weekends are supposed to rejuvenate you. Be a time to relax and catch up on 'you time'. Maybe you aren't loving yourself enough?

I still suggest that you get up, shower, and get dressed on the weekends. Perhaps at least go for a walk to get out of the house. And definitely keep your therapy appointment. It always helps to talk to someone else.

Good luck.",2,0.8245

So I think it's more of a backlash because people feel like he's transparently being fed to them as the face of the season. And maybe there's an impression that he's aware of his archetype and he's playing it up to get screen time and become a big character.

dnqil9c,"So yeah. Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) 

On this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because, well I'm a bigger guy and in Japan it's already a big disadvantage lol 

With the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could've been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from 

So we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.

Now I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.

She caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. 

We sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a \"western man\" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said \"very big\" (now for record, she's clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)

She told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. 

After I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth \"you must wait\" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.

I stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.

We finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!

She sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.

After willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i'll never forget.

I had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.

After seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.

So I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. 

There was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.

We lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I'm in Japan next we'll be able to hook up again :)",9,0.9985

I would bring it up very delicately and with a heaping amount of support. An unexpected job change after 30 years is a very stressful thing to happen. It's right up there with school, marriage, and funerals. Being depressed is hard and requires a lot of unrequited support.  Try doing activities or planned days where you spend most of the day together.

We see that the girl goes out from the back exit and has sex with the guy's friend. She knows that the guy wants to confess to her and she wants to be with him. The friend comes inside her so he uses an special cork-like thing to close her pussy so the semen doesn't come out, he promises to remove it when the guy confesses.

As time passes, the guy doesn't confess, the girl keeps coming out and the friend fucks her ass.

In the end she can't take it anymore and she leaves the guy hanging asking the friend to remove the cork and fuck her.

The doujin ends with the friend lamenting that the guy never confessed, and that he would definitely enjoy her while the girl is filled with semen on all holes and discarded on the ground.

SFV is just too trash for me to go back. If they actually do SuperSFV maybeeeeee

Everyone knew what Capcom was doing w/ SFV, and the casuals(well, most of them) didn't buy it. We're seeing Capcom double down on stupidity and ESPORTS greed w/ MVCI.

I was soooooo done with the game when i realized alex was in the same tier(trash) he was in SFIII. All those alex avatars and alex hype and he can't be played. I'm not even a juri fan but it's a tragedy what they did to her - and a good example of some of the idiocy of capcom

People also did interpret Daniel, and Revelation for thinking the end times were in the 70s-80s because of the cold war.

Yet you kinda further compounded the point of my post: you happily embrace things that are fully supportive of your view, and stop caring, or ignore everything you dislike. 


I would seriously suggest recognizing that your side in anything may not be perfect, and that you need to take on challenging views otherwise you risk falling into the same trap that the FSA fell into where they became so full of hatred and willing blindness to the evil that claimed to support their revolution, that they allowed themselves to be so distanced from reality that none saw how the evil had long usurped their cause.

dnqili1,"I'm a seamstress, do mostly costuming and reenactment garb. Being an empath in this line of work is incredibly helpful because most people know what they want, but have zero idea how to put words to the vision in their heads. Just through conversation  (in person, of course!), I can get a solid feel for my clients' costuming desires. They seem to think it's magic that I \"just get them.\" :)  Oddly enough, I'm certain my empath abilities also translate into an ability to make things that fit perfectly the first time they try them on.

(Just a note: I did *not* go to school for fashion design or tailoring. I'm self-taught.)

Anyway, the point here is that your coworker doesn't necessarily need to go into typical \"healer\" type work. If she enjoys working with her hands and being creative, there are jobs that involve working with the public *and* creative activities. Interior design, home remodeling, custom sewing, commissioned art... heck, even designer cakes. And, if her parents are dead-set on her going to college, these are all things that she can get an Associate or Bachelor degree in.

dnqilik,"2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.

3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.

Recently the \"new meta\" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  

4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify.",5,0.98

I guess I could have her target lines back saying that she doesn't know where this \"America\" city is, but later Marionette calls her a Westerner, which means Aimee can't have already corrected her.

dnqillx,"I was also overweight going into pregnancy, and I lost weight both pregnancies during the first half. I finally stabilized at the same weight as my last visit at my 20 week appointment. I think I followed the same trend last time, but I still only gained a net 7 pounds when my 7 pound baby was delivered. But she was 7 pounds 5 ounces at 38 weeks and perfectly healthy. She always measured on track, and my doctor never said anything negative. I also went on to gain all the baby weight from stress and comfort eating postpartum. :/ Really, if your baby is growing well and your doctor isn't worried, especially if you have fat stored up, weight gain isn't strictly necessary. You and baby both will be fueled off your stored fat (which is the purpose of it). You just really want to make sure you're getting enough calcium (baby will leach it straight out of your bones if you're not getting enough from your diet). And keep up on your prenatal vitamin.

So my appetite is pretty small. I just can't eat much at a sitting and loading up at meals isn't an option for me. Figure out healthy, reasonably energy dense foods you can snack on through the day like nuts and cheese, fruits and veggies. I like to nibble on beef jerky sometimes or peanut butter. I also started drinking milk sometimes, mostly because I think it's tasty but I only seem to when I'm pregnant.",1,0.9943

But on topic RobinF's defensive stats are better than Indigo due to her physical bulk, Indigo requires lots of work to make work in dealing with the more advanced players with heavy merged BLyn's and Reinhardts, which are really common personally. Compared to RobinF who with a few merges can counter +10 opposition running double goads and hone.

Indigo requires bowbreaker (or lots of spurs) to kill a BLyn that runs Mulagir. Ignoring defensive battles, at neutral atk, a simple +6 atk from any source (Ex. Hone/Ally Support) is enough for Indigo to kill a BLyn running Brave Bow, this of course changes dramatically if they run fortify as well. 

The simplest way for Indigo to deal with Blyn is bow breaker, which comes at an expense for some in the form of WoM or GTB.

Meta Reinhardt's running QP/DB/DB3/Moonbow with 1 hone and goad can still kill a unmerged RES Indigo not running buffs, requiring +3~5 res to handle hone x1goad/x2 goads, which can be simply Fort Res1 Seal+Ally Support+HP/Res Seal on Indigo.

tl;dr unmerged Indigo will help against unmerged opposition like a prince charming. But against more invested teams, not so much without severe buff work, you'll probably sacrifice something to fit him to do his job when he needs to pull the weight of his intended roll.

Also - an issue I had when playing around with accordion tables was that I couldn't collapse all panels simultaneously, and was forced to have exactly one expanded at all times. Can this behaviour be changed so that they all start collapsed and only expand/collapse when clicked?

Would it be reasonable to put an accordion table inside another? Cause it seems to me like I'd have to to achieve two levels as intended. While we're at it, would it be possible to dynamically add panels to both levels based on the imported data (mentioned in point 3 in the OP)?

I thought they had to tie into Audrey because of the \"Billy\" and \"Tina\" connections. Alas, we are left with no resolution on this, just like we are left with no resolution on Audrey whatsoever.

I think your instincts are good, but that you are being too specific and literal with these scenes. Someone already posted the Lynch quote saying that the Roadhouse vignettes were never meant to be anything other than \"slice-of-life\" moments in the town of Twin Peaks, with no connection to the larger story. What I do think they connect to are the themes of awakening and duality. The show gives us many clues that we are watching two worlds, and that awakening is the key to crossing from one to the other.

In my opinion, the Roadhouse is a junction point between worlds. Anyone seen in the Roadhouse is not awakened in the beginning of TP, and awakens by the end.

* Audrey is the most obvious
* James was in an accident and is \"quiet\" now
* Shelly is trapped in the same self-destructive cycle of being with terrible men

The random bar conversations are part of this same routine. Whether it's drugs or insanity or infidelity, the people are all trapped in some kind of cage. When they awaken, they will be gone from the Roadhouse forever, just like Audrey.

Richard was probably trapped by his own evil heart, hence his appearance at the Roadhouse. But unlike the others, he didn't get a chance to awaken. He just got killed.",1,-0.9921

Thanks for the reply! 

I think that even in books that feature primarily or solely non-human characters the main scope would still fall under sociology, since it is impossible to be completely divorced from our own humanity. It would then be a view of humanity through an alien lens, but still a human view by necessity. Because if it were to be fully alien then there would be nothing for a human reader to identify themselves with. 

In the seminal \"The Dance of the Changer and Three\" by Terry Carr the only human character is the narrator who tries to explain this fully alien story to a human audience and coming to the conclusion that the story must be taken as is, because they are alien any human interpretation of this story that is so important to this alien culture must always fall flat because we cannot ever completely understand their psychology. 

The Dance of the Changer and Three teaches us that whatever we do, we will always be locked inside our own skulls, viewing the universe through human eyes.

Below are few details of what they have going on and I also received a newsletter from them that they will be expanding their investment options so, I think this site is not a scam but like all HYIP's, withdraw your monies on a daily basis. So far, I have earned over $100 and have only been in it for 2 weeks. I usually test the waters first before I invest a bit more and with that said, I will be investing into LiteCoin. 2 investment options: 147% after 6 weeks and 180% after 9 weeks. Interest: 3.97% on working days and 1.00% on weekends. Minimum deposit: 0.005 BTC. Refund of the principal along with interest payments. Withdrawal minimum: 0.005 BTC or $10. Payment methods: Bitcoin or USD equivalent. Affiliate program: 10%-5%-2%. Here's the link to join this opportunity and like I always say, I am not a financial adviser thus, you are investing into these things at your own risk.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

I see a bit more actual substance to some of his claims than you do, clearly.

I agree with you, the hate crime law doesn't seem to me like a slippery slope to anything. I do agree with his proposition that you cannot codify into law preferred pronoun usage. I would never intentionally misgender someone, and I would do my best to use whatever pronoun a person prefers, but I do not want to live in a society where it's a crime if I get that wrong.

I think the nuclear family is a model that works for many people, but I know in point of fact that it does not work for many others. I think people should be free to do what they see fit. I know of no evidence that suggests gay adoption is in any way inferior to straight adoption. I wasn't aware he had made statements to that affect, but it doesn't totally surprise me that he did.

I agree that we should encourage people to embrace their gender and sexuality as fluid. More freedom and more ability to be true to one's reality is good. 

But I agree with him that there is an anti-science and anti-discourse bent to some of the present political climate on the left. I'm squarely in the left on the American political spectrum, but I sense more and more that there is a tendency to dismiss anything, whether an idea, a study, or a person, that conflicts with progressive views as so self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful as to not even deserve consideration. I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right. The right does it to the left. That's probably always been so. But I feel increasingly the far left does it to people who basically share their goals.

I studied a fair bit of postmodern philosophy in school, which I admit was several years ago now. I kind of agree with his characterization of its issues and flaws (basically that its claims are true only in the abstract and claims that cannot be functionally applied should be treated as false, even if not logically falsifiable- like, for instance, solipsism). I do not share his opinion that the whole thing has an underlying ulterior motive of destroying Western civilization. I would be interested specifically in your take on where he strays regarding postmodern philosophy, because it's been a while for me.

I think certain academic disciplines are rather corrupt. I'm open to discussion about a lot of things, but it's wild to me that a Yale professor more or less got run out of town for questioning whether cultural appropriation is for real. Cultural appropriation, microaggressions, patriarchy, white privilege, rape culture... I think there's real, honest to God truth in this stuff, but when I really think about the world I live in, I have trouble swallowing some of it whole hog without adding at least a pinch of nuance. And if a professor at an institution can lose their job for trying to do so, how can anyone else? Shouldn't we want to know the truth about those things? Doesn't that require critical reflection?

And, for the Christianity piece, I think he makes an excellent observation (or takes one, anyway, from Dostoevsky and Neitzsche). The erosion of that as a unifying force has increased the chaos in societies. But I don't share his pessimism or resentment about it. Our society is more plural. I think the Christian tradition gave societies a toolkit. I believe that any tools from that kit that still have value will be retained, and to hell with the rest. But I don't disagree with his notion (and this was more or less Neitzsche's take) that you can toss out bad tools from Christianity, and perhaps we must, but that doesn't mean you immediately have replacements that work better. I believe we'll find them, but I do think the twentieth century had it's share of nihilism, and I do think that even today people struggle to find purpose and it can harm them. I don't mourn Christianity, and I assume we'll figure that out, but it's fair to say that, absent an externally imposed value system, people struggle to create an internal one. That's a real phenomenon in my opinion.",1,0.9862

This is self-publishing. You literally could self-publish a book on Amazon in ten minutes. And then there are services which you pay to publish your book, like the one OP used.

Dominant decks force players to either run the dominant strategy themselves or something that can win reliably against it. This severely limits the amount of strategies instead of diversifying them.

Long answer, Norovirus is extremely contagious. Just a few parts per million can make you violently ill. You can also get reinfected over and over. Which is what happened to DS and I. 

DS was ok during the day but in the middle of the night he would wake up sick. He has autism so when he would get sick he would panic and try to out run the projectile vomiting. Every night he would run through the house projectile vomiting at least once. Every room in the house was covered in vomit except my daughter's. My bed, his bed, the couch, the arm chairs, my bookshelf, nothing was left untouched. I would spend hours cleaning every night.

He woke me up one night by puking in my face.

As you can imagine, it took a long time for the kid and I to shake it. Surprisingly, DH and DD never got sick.

The only company I've ever heard had that as a major issue was Armadillo Aerospace, where I heard that fuel was about a third of their capital costs in the development of the Mod vehicle that they used in the Lunar Lander Challenge.  That was a whole lot of actual flying time for the vehicle, and it showed in the end with a very sturdy and reliable vehicle.  It is also something pretty common in terms of research teams doing VTOL rocket research to have a whole lot of flights.

That is something you have the luxury to do when you have a reusable vehicle.... which fortunately the BFR is going to be.  It wouldn't surprise me if there were over a thousand flights (perhaps just suborbital) before any passengers ever went on board.

I'm hoping that the constellation will start going up before the BFR is ready for revenue service with satellites, but that certainly is a possibility too.  I really want to see a bunch of videos [just like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdjxPY2j_0) with the BFR in the meantime.",4,0.9124

If I could relive just one day, it would be a day in July of last year when after more than 25 years I sat down to have lunch with my best childhood friend. We talked about all that had happened over the many years in-between. He looked so different. If you saw him walking down the street, his old clothes, his long tangled and unwashed hair, nearly all his exposed skin covered in tattoos and a cigarette hanging from his mouth, you'd have wanted to avoid him. He looked like an absolute badass who might just be completely and unpredictably violent. Except that's not who he really was on the inside. He was still the same kind and thoughtful guy I knew from my childhood. He'd had more than his fair share of misfortune. Some of it was his fault and some wasn't but he owned every bit of it. He never blamed anyone but himself. When I asked him how he manages it all he said, \"It's my life. What else can I do?\"

Afterwards we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, back to our families and our lives. I was so happy to have reconnected with him and I thought we'd continue to be a part of each other's lives for many years to come.

I totally didn't expect his reaction, I thought he would shrug and pretend he didn't care. He did care. He cried his eyes out and begged me to stay, asked me over and over to please stay and give him one more chance. Even clung to me and kept saying please please please, I'll do everything different! It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life, walking away and purposely hurting someone to save my own happiness. It was the hardest but also the best decision I have ever made. It has been years since then and I'm sure he had a hard time at first. There was just nothing I could do for him, every conversation we had just gave him hope we would be okay again. I'm glad he could rely on his parents for support. I felt so guilty at first, especially because I started dating someone new a lot earlier than him. However years later we are both in relationships with different people who suit us much better. I honestly think he would agree now that it was for the best. This was my personal anecdote, I hope it gives you hope that down the line everything will be okay üòä the heavy feeling and the guilt will lessen over time, you are not responsible for his happiness.

You had one job to do.  Feed the dog and cat.

They trusted you with a key to their home to do that job.  Instead of doing just that, you went through all the corners of their home and figuratively rubbed your scent in it.

You showed that you have no consideration or respect for your adult son and his adult wife and their decisions about their life.  Had you been considerate, you would have offered to do a deep cleaning, listing out the things that you could do for their home.  This could have been done through a phone call or a text message and you should wait for an answer before doing anything else.  

I am very leery that you say you organized.  By that, did you straighten up a pile of papers on the table?  Or did you rearrange cupboards and furniture?  If your cleaning included more than squaring away a pile of papers so they are not on the verge of falling off the pile, you overstepped big time.  By the way your son described your actions and called you presumptuous and controlling, I suspect you did a lot more than cleaning surfaces that were dirty, other than doing laundry.

If you wanted to help, you need to ask in what form they would accept your help.  You don't barge in and start doing things without their knowledge and consent.

I have a followup question for you?  Did you keep the key or did you give it back?  If you didn't give it back (why not?), have you USED the key without their prior knowledge?  If you've used the key, you are more than an asshole very much deserving of the cold shoulders thrown your way.",22,0.9295

But since I know the estate quite well I can probably evade it reasonably easily, for a small time at least.  
So my plan is to collect some firelighters and kindling materials, and a load of ceramic plant pots. I'm also buying some duct tape, rope, some food and water. And a few of those foil emergency blankets. I'm going to make a bunch of small fires all over the place, and use them to heat the ceramic pots. These are to serve as false heat signatures all over the place.  
Meanwhile, I'll be in an alley across the street, behind a fence, covered in the foil blankets to conceal body heat. The tank will probably use the road to get to my address because my cul-de-sac is relatively inaccessible without driving through other houses. That puts me right behind it, at which point I run and climb right on top of the turret. That'll take like 5 seconds, so hopefully I'm not spotted.  Once on top I lie spread eagled, and securely rope/tape myself to whatever stanchions and protuberances there are on top, in order to avoid exhausting myself or falling off.

Luckily for you - or maybe not so much - I read your entire reply. In this comment I will be clearing some things up, setting the records straight, while replying to some of your remarks directly. Therefore I will quote your previous post in order to achieve full transparency. I feel we need this in both of our lives right now. Correct me if I'm being to presumptuous. 

**Honest**
&gt;I thank you for your honest reply

I must confess. I wasn't honest at all, for I have never read the 4th issue of The Thanos Imperative. So I merely guessed that Thanos said \"No\" in this issue. My conclusion - as you have correctly pointed out - is flawed and playfull mockery. 

**Fun**
&gt;As it seems you have not quite understood the latter point, let me put it to you as plainly as I can. This post was made for fun.

While I was teasing you with my clearly false theory - on which I will elaborate later - it wasn't my intention to give you the impression that I took your theory fully serious or that I didn't enjoy myself. Although this section isn't titled **honest**, I still believe I am when I state that my opening sentence was fully sincere. I shall quote myself here - one thing I always enjoy doing - to show you to what sentence I'm referring: \"I intensely enjoyed reading your - how shall I call it? - Theory.\" Your writing style, wit and the theory itself are entertaining. I was merely inspired by your post to reply with another theory. And since I do not believe in the meaning you get from those numbers (D23), I decided to exaggerate in an even more far-fetched theory. 

**I told you so**
&gt;your telling me \"I told you so\" has no meaning

In my modest opinion. I told you so always has meaning. If nothing else, it may hint at a character flaw of the one posing this statement. 

**My clearly false theory**
&gt;I can only imagine how long it took you to accomplish this.

It took me 10 minutes. I think. 

&gt; Your theory was built on three numbers which were never shown in the film; to discover them one would have to pay very close attention to the film and, likely as not, watch it multiple times. 

I googled \"Captain America Winter Soldier Numbers\" in order to get some data quickly. I quickly found this picture: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/8f/9b/a98f9bce6365417da8056ae3339d8e7c.jpg
I choose three numbers - which only had in common that Captain America himself was involved - and tried googling some dates. Luckily I found that The Thanos Imperative was released on one of the possible dates. As you can see, this is no achievement at all. Of course, while having fun, I was also trying to point out that giving meaning to numbers isn't that difficult. And while I will admit, the numbers in your theory have a clearer connection to each other, I still think it isn't a meaningful one. I cannot disprove this - and since you're not that serious about it, I probably won't have to - but I simply highly, highly doubt a director or marketing team would put in coded messages about trailer drops for a movie that far ahead of time. It is way more likely that this is just coincidence (if the trailer does drop at October 14th). 

**The Trailer**
&gt;As I mentioned in my original post, a quick look through recent activity will reveal that the most popular answer is \"sometime in October\"

This is likely. I think the trailer will drop around Thor: Ragnarok. This strategy will remind moviegoers that the Thor film might be worth checking out because he's in Infinity War. And we all want to know which events will lead-up to that movie. But this is merely a prediction of Marvels overall strategy. You probably wouldn't be surprised at this point that I too think the Infinity War trailer will be dropped at the end of October or the beginning of November. \"Around October\" sounds accurate to me. 

u/AdmiralSnackBar69's analysis is therefore much more reliable then your fun-to-read-theory. He doesn't look at a coded message - which we just entertainingly assume it might be a coded message - but he looks at production trends. 

**Closing**

It was never my intend to be hurtful or mock you as an author. I really enjoyed reading your text. So maybe I didn't formulate my reply as carefully as I could have. English isn't my first language, so communicating can be difficult sometimes. That being said, I don't feel you took it the wrong way. Your reply was equally entertaining. This exchange of simple words we've had today was so fun and inspiring, that I think we should become electronic pen pals. 

To summarize: 

- I had fun reading your original post and your reply. 

- I was fully aware you were not entirely serious. 

- My theory was very much incorrect. 

- I think a trailer will drop in October/November.

- While I was mocking, I hope you know by now it wasn't meant to be hurtful, personal or hateful.

dnqimql,"Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: .¬†.¬†. a society without an organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of¬†objectivelaws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government.

‚ÄúThe Nature of Government,‚Äù
The Virtue of Selfishness, 112

¬∂

If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compel every citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot any strangers approaching his door‚Äîor to join a protective gang of citizens who would fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about the degeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by brute force, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.

The use of physical force‚Äîeven its retaliatory use‚Äîcannot be left at the discretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a man has to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him by any of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors‚Äô intentions are good or bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they are motivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice‚Äîthe use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision of another.

Two won't play **food chain magnate**. They got absolutely demolished in their first game, to the point where they were \"irrelevant bystanders\" after turn 3. Never again, they said.

One won't play **alchemists** because it reminds him of being in college and he goes to game night to forget school and work.

One won't play **resistance or secret Hitler** because he's a (young) retired Afghanistan war vet with ptsd and those games trigger him too much. He gets way to stressed out.

Two friends won't play **arboretum** , and these are two really good gamers, not snowflakes. But the hand restriction is so stressful that they can't have fun with it. Of those two, one won't play **bazaar** because the thought process required to play optimally is so brain burny that he doesn't think it's worth it. That being said, he'll play fcm and battlecon with me all day, ironically.

Another friend has kids 10, 8, 6, who all like game, but they won't play **escape curse of the temple** again because the last game ended in tears, shouting, and rage. The mom and 10 year old did fine, but the 8&amp;6 struggled, and I split the group up poorly. So idiotic, I should have been with the 8&amp;6, not with the 10.

I almost won't play **splendor** anymore because it removes all socialization and leads to some outburst when someone grabs the card someone else wanted.

One guy won't play **acquire** because he ran out of money real fast, couldn't buy stocks for like 6 turns, didn't have the tiles to force a merger, and walked away feeling like it was a luck fest that punished you too hard for being careless with your money. Dunno, me neither..?

One won't play **Chinatown** because the endgame is too mathy and predictable (easy to solve).

And another won't play **dominion** anymore because it's too themeless and too pure, ie he prefers Clank, where deck building is a means to an end, not an end. By the way, he's never played a dominion expansion.

I won't play any of the **legendary** series games, **monopoly, munchkin, galaxy trucker, mice n mystics, or Robinson Crusoe** because I don't feel I have enough player agency. I feel like the game is playing ME",1,-0.9744

In your example, we'd start with the base sentence:

\"I had dinner with my uncle and a madman and an accordion player.\"

This obviously isn't proper grammar, so we'd replace the first \"and\" with a comma since we've created a list:

\"I had dinner with my uncle, a madman and an accordion player.\"

In this case anyone with a grasp on context clues would understand what one was trying to say. If this was being said aloud then it would be the burden of the person pronouncing it to clarify what they were saying.

I will submit that there are situations where an oxford comma is necessary, but they are few and far inbetween. Meanwhile our society expounds into our heads at a young age that we must always use the oxford comma whenever we write regardless of the situation.

I still use them, but only because of I've been oppressed by our society which worships them to the point where that oppression is now internalized in all within. Break the cycle, fight the Punctriarchy.",1,0.3919

If you were starting a team and could pick any QB that's ever played, there aren't many you could put above him. Elway's combination of mobility, toughness, a rocket arm and fierce competitiveness make him a compelling choice regardless of who he's compared to. Let's give give it a shot:

**Brady**: Simply one of the greatest to ever play the game, period. He's also had the benefit of playing for THE greatest head coach of all time. That has to be factored into this evaluation. Would Brady have been as great under multiple head coaches? Although we'll never know the answer definitively, history shows that it'd be very difficult to replicate Brady's success under different coaches.

Elway however went to five Super Bowls under two different head coaches. Neither of these coaches would even be in the running of GOAT. Also if you compare the QBs head-to-head, Elway is more athletic and mobile than Brady while being just as competitive (Brady's best attribute). Advantage Elway

**Favre**: I never understood why Favre was treated with such reverence when he played. Whenever I think of Favre, I think of back-breaking picks in the playoffs. That alone disqualifies him from consideration. 

**Peyton Manning** : Great QB. Gaudy stats. Four Super Bowl appearances with four different head coaches. I wouldn't start him over Elway though. Elway is more mobile and tougher, but his biggest advantage is that he played his best ball under pressure. That's Peyton's biggest weakness. That's a big weakness of most QBs. 

**Marino**: Well he was a great QB to be sure. I think his stats were better than Elway overall. But Marino had a downside. I read recently he had less than 100 yards rushing for his ENTIRE career. So even if Marino was a better passer than Elway, I'd consider his lack of mobility to be a significant disadvantage. Also--and this probably isn't all his fault necessarily-- he played for two Super Bowl winning coaches and only had one SB appearance.  Elway took three Reeves-coached squads to the Super Bowl that had no business being there. That's how good he was.  Quick who was Elway's top receiver on those teams? Who was his running back? I can't remember and I actually WATCHED those teams! 

**Montana** : Joe Montana was a fucking great QB and arguably is the GOAT. As a fan of both the Broncos and Cowboys (don't ask), I had the pleasure of having my heart ripped out by this muthafucker for over a decade. Accurate, cool under fire with the heart of a champion.  But here's the thing about Montana...dude was fragile by NFL standards. If you put a solid lick on him, he wouldn't get up. That's why he didn't finish his career as a 49er. Toughness is important in this position. Elway was a tough sumamabitch.",15,0.998

dnqimzp,"Think he's reading into Moreno's comments a bit too much. Anyone who watches us closely will have noticed that we don't press anywhere near as much anymore, and it's a conscious change.

Could be many reasons for it. One is that we have the CL this season so we can't afford to play such a high energy game every week. We don't have that deep of a squad, and Klopp thus far has only really rotated in the full back areas. City/Spurs have rotated far more effectively than us. Also worth remembering we have the CL playoff round which added games for us, while having to deal with the absence of Clyne, Lallana, Coutinho and dealing with bringing back players from injury (Hendo/Mane/Sturridge).

Another is that pressing, while effective, when it isn't working, leaves your midfield and defence exposed. Notably when Lallana is missing, we don't have a natural doggish presser aside from Firmino, so Klopp is being pragmatic in the absence of Lallana in order to protect our already vulnerable defence. I can imagine Klopp remembers playing a high pressing game away at Bournemouth or Leicester and then getting caught by simple long balls into the channels.

I remember when Klopp first arrived, the number of hamstring/calf injuries was ridiculous. These injuries have slowed down somewhat, but a less intensive pressing game will have helped.",6,0.2438

The NSA's domestic spying is literally fascist. Not the Left's new definition which is \"Trump supports it\", but actually fascist. Both the Right and the Left largely support it out of fear, but it's a very far right program. It wouldn't have been allowed before 9/11.

dnqin1m,"I have to agree with a lot of the critiques here.  The pilot showed a lot of promise, but the show just went down hill from there.  The show had so much potential to be an accurate portrayal of the origins of hip hop and how the culture of the 70s in NYC really influenced not only a generation but changed the landscape of the music industry in general.  

But sadly they just didn't portray it very realistically and it wasn't, like someone else said, raw or real enough.  And don't get me started on the whole rape scene where Leslie Lesgold forces Jackie Moreno to go down on her because he once coerced her into giving him a blowjob and then fired her way back when she interned for him.  Really?  Such BS and so completely unrealistic.  I lived through that era, women got used and sexually exploited all the time and not just in the music industry.  Back then it was the unofficial and deeply repulsive status quo that in order for a woman to get a ahead, pardon the pun, she had to give head and much more. If she didn't play that game she got black listed and her career was over.  

Once a woman gained stardom then it was different story, but even then the male power players of the day ran the show and their word was law.  Back then no woman would dare pull some revenge crap like Leslie did, because no male power player then would ever allow a woman to have that kind of power.  Sorry ladies but rape revenge like what Leslie did, however empowering and entertaining, was not only not practical but due to the culture of the time would never have happened. So yeah that was the big BS exclamation point on the ending of that show, that and the ridiculous amount of money Netflix spent on it.  The Get Down deserved to get cancelled.  Overall though, with all of Netflix's other hit shows, one miss like the get down shouldn't hurt their overhead much at all.  They are still hitting it out of the park with shows like Luke Cage and Stranger Things, as well as a lot of their other original shows and the ones they currently got in development.

So they leave, and it's just the 3 of us at the kitchen table. I was so excited about it that I kept dropping hints until it was obvious and she just broke down crying. I had never seen her cry before, and granted she was stressed from everything but its probably the worst memory I have with her. She tried so hard to make a perfect Christmas and circumstances (as I know I was a kid and didn't do it on purpose) just took that away from her, as was common in general for her.

I've upgraded literally 7 total units to 5* with the amount of Feathers I've gathered since I started playing and I don't have enough to upgrade someone to 5* right now. And two of those were 4* s I pulled and wanted to build up, like a ton of other users would want to do with their favorite units, which would be a much more important goal for them than raising their Virion to 4* level 40 using the Feathers and stamina they would've otherwise put into a +10 Selena or something. 
Even if somehow there was several thousand like minded individuals who did that, you'd still not be able to follow a lot of guides because they require 3* s, and throwing off stats even IV wise entirely messes up strategies. Some strategies need people like Arthur or Stahl or Serena there at 3* because they can soak hits, but won't kill a specific unit at a choke point. So bringing your 4* Serena/Arthur/Stahl means you mess up the strategy, the Axe you were stalling dies, and the Lance behind it kills Serena/Stahl instead. 
 
Besides the whole \"yeah but what if this or what if that\", the entire point is \"what if people don't have this\", your argument here is \"well, they should\", my point is \"yeah, but they don't\". How does your argument actually fix the situation those people are in who see that video about the easy 4* Oboro level 40 wall strategy, and then realize they'd have to spend like 150 stamina and 2000 Feathers just for this one orb they're wanting to earn?",2,-0.1646

Streak: 6W

Pick record: 23-2-16

Bonus Picks record: 17-1-23
***

*Had a decent day yesterday. The POTD pick - Coventry won, and I got 4/6 picks as winners with one other as a push*

**POTD:**

**Double: Torino to Win &amp; Inter Milan to Win - 1.60 (L - 2-2 &amp; 1-2. Torino concede 2 goals in the last 6 minutes to lose the bet, unbelievable!)**

Now I like to stick to singles, especially for POTD but after researching through all the games I like today there's nothing that puts me over the edge for certainly other than these picks. I was thinking of doing the Lazio game O2.5 goals as I can see both teams scoring there or even Lazio scoring 3 just themselves but I'm not 100% confident and a 2-0 win in that game wouldn't surprise me. 

So, into detail about Torino's game. They host Verona today who I've talked about in previous picks about how utterly terrible they are and if reports are to be believed their manager is close to the sack. Verona have looked hopeless through 6 games with a record of 0-2-4, only scoring 1 (from a penalty) and conceding 14. 

Torino have been decent so far this season. They find themselves 7th with a record of 3-2-1, goals 10:9. Attackers Belotti and Ljajic have been in good form with 3 goals each and are very likely to score today, Belotti has scored in the two home games Torino have played so far. With Verona's horrible scoring record I doubt they'll score today but if they do it'll only be 1 and Torino have more than enough quality to get 2+. Defensive mid Baselli will be missing after being sent off last week, Obi &amp; Barreca will also miss out for the hosts but they'll be able to cope without them. 

In the other game, Inter play away to Benevento who are equally as bad as Verona and sit in last place, also just scoring the 1 goal and have conceded 16 goals already after being smashed by Napoli 6-0 and Roma 4-0. It won't get any easier for them here against Inter who have won 5 and drawn once in their games and have the best defensive record in the league. 

Inter were lucky to win last week against Genoa, but they continued their record of scoring in every game. That comes mostly thanks to Icardi who is up to 6 goals already and will like his chances of bagging a couple today, I might put a little on him to even get a hat trick. As far as injuries go Inter are only missing Cancelo who hasn't played in a month anyway. It could be a rout here after some of Benevento's performances but Inter don't tend to be a big scoring team so I'm expecting 2-0/3-0 here. 

***
*Quite a lot of games I like today, so I'll try to whittle them down to just the better looking ones for picks*

**Picks:**

‚Ä¢ **Arsenal v Brighton - Arsenal Clean Sheet YES - 1.80 (W - 2-0)**

Originally this pick was going to be Arsenal to Win to Nil but the odds so similar for just a clean sheet that it seems much more worth it in case Arsenal can't score somehow. 

Arsenal have kept their last 6/8 home matches as clean sheets. They've shown how impressive at home they are winning all their games so far conceding all their only hole goals let in in that early 4-3 thriller against Leicester. 

Brighton have struggled for goals this season, they're scored 5 in 6 (3 goals coming against West Brom) and have only scored 1 away from home so far. To get a better look at how I expect this game to play out I looked at how they faired against their only big team they faced yet Man City and the stats show a 79/21% possession to Man City, showing that Brighton are likely to sit back and try to grind out a draw today against Arsenal. 

‚Ä¢ **Everton v Burnley - Burnley or Draw - 2.25 (W - 0-1)**

I fucked up here, looking at the odds Burnley +1.0AH @1.65 are a much better pick than this so if you're reading this pick late I would take that, I still feel Burnley can draw here and I won't change my pick after the fact so here are the stats. 

Burnley have performed well this season with a record of 2-3-1, goals 6:5. Away from home Burnley have really turned it on after a terrible record last season, this season they won at Chelsea 2-1, as well as getting 1-1 draws at Spurs &amp; Liverpool. If Burnley do lose it tends to be only by a goal, although last season Everton were one of the only teams able to beat by that margin winning 3-1 but this is a different Everton this year. 

Everton have struggled for goals. They've scored 4 in 6, 2 of them coming last game where they were fortunate to get away with a win. Koeman is under pressure at the moment and will want to continue Everton's winning streak. If Burnley are able to get the first goal then the Goodison Park crowd will be booing and they will get on their players backs, that pressure might be too much. 

‚Ä¢ **Atalanta v Juventus -- BTTS - 1.95 (W - 2-2)**

The head to head record here has BTTS in the last 4/6. Atalanta have had 5/6 BTTS too. Both teams have scored in all of their games so far (except for when Juve played Barca). I think both teams will fancy their chances and have inform players on either side in Gomez and Dybala. I like the O2.5 goals here too, it was 2-2 in this game last season and it could be agin today. 

‚Ä¢ **Torino v Verona -- Torino Clean Sheet YES - 2.20 (L - 2-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -2.0 Asian Handicap - 2.20 (L - 1-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter to Win to Nil - 1.95 (L - 0-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Hertha Berlin v Bayern Munich -- Hertha Berlin to Score 1+ goals - 1.90 (W - 2-2)**

I've explained this pick in a comment below. 

‚Ä¢ **Koln v RB Leipzig -- Leipzig to Win - 2.00 (W - 1-2)**

‚Ä¢ **Nice v Marseille -- Nice Draw No Bet - 1.92 (L - 2-4. Nice we're 2-0 up! That would have paid out with some bookies Ina straight win, how annoying)**

‚Ä¢ **Maritimo v Benfica -- Maritimo +1.0 Asian Handicap - 2.06 (W - 1-1)**

*Lastly, I would not advise putting these all into an acca. As much as I'd like them all to win, it's always unlikely with this many picks so if you do feel you have to combine them in some way please choose a double of your favs or even a treble. Anything more and you're asking for trouble.*

**Bonus Picks: (Odds of Evens or greater)**

‚Ä¢ Everton v Burnley -- Draw - 3.80 (L)

‚Ä¢ Newcastle v Liverpool -- BTTS &amp; O2.5 goals - 2.00 (L)

Usually i will run around doing public events and killing all the high priorities that i can possibly find. There are also things called scavengers that spawn every once in a while where you kill 2 servitors and get a chest. Not only that but you can also find whatever the planet resource is for that planet and get it when possible (like on Nessus it would be the datalattice). But id say that the best tip I can give is buy lots of those chest locaters from cayde definitely. Chests give 1 token for almost no effort as opposed to public events giving 1 for ~3 or 4 minutes of your time.,1,0.8218

dnqinl3,"What you call judging, I call making an educated guess on modern gaming trends and logic. EA is replacing a 50 dollar season pass with star cards that give you statistical advantages. How do you get people to buy those star cards? By giving them substantial advantages. Which you posted above would indeed allow you to compete, star cards shouldn't be that good that you cannot compete. You're paying money, to be better at a game. That's the exact definition of paytowin. I'm asking EA to remove the statistical advantage from crates and make them strictly unlocks. EA can continue the franchise by making money off of cosmetics. EA has more money than any of us would ever spend in a lifetime. COD games had unlock based progression for a long time before supply drops and no one complains then. You will be just fine earning your progress instead of buying it, you will live. The game won't die because people have to earn their progress. Stop being dramatic. 

And because I'm asking for a game that's fair dosent mean that I'm jealous if someone has a Ferrari and I don't lol. You're being very dramatic and I'm getting vibes that YOU are offended by this conversation, which is pretty immature. I'm asking for a video game to have an even playing field not for EA to build a rocket ship. Cosmetic only microtransactions isn't something crazy to ask for. 

And a few more things, fighting RNG bullshit crates dosent make something challenging, It's completely random and has no pride or reflects hard work. It's all based on how lucky you are or how much money you spend. As someone from the older generation I'd expect you to understand that. Hard work = nice things not throwing money at the screen. If you actually read my posts you would know that I wasn't asking for things to be handed to me. I work, go to school, sleep, repeat. I don't have much time to play either. But that doesn't mean I would rather have the ability to pay to be good at the game.

When the destructive animal industry is reduced and we through political measures reduce (but hopefully fucking **end**) the exploitation of third world countries by the west, these people will over time recover and finally be given the opportunity and *room* to grow.

dnqint0,"The problem with Yotsuyu was that there was no possible way that everyone in the entire country of Doma knew what was happening to her and did nothing.  If she had gone after revenge against the people that mistreated her then we could empathize with her.  However, she chose to brutalize every Doman for what happened to her, probably including those who suffered similar injustices.  There should be no redemption for her.

Everyone likes to discuss Fordola and explain her actions away as well but the crux of the matter is not that she was an Ala Mighan that turned traitor to Ala Migho, but rather that she chose to participate in the atrocities committed by the Garlean Empire.  I have no issue with her seeing herself as a Garlean, I only have issue with what she did as a Garlean.  There is no excuse for the things she was doing to civilians in the name of the Empire.  

Zenos was just too crazy to let live.

All too often people try to empathize with the villain and excuse their actions on the basis of the fact that they suffered in the past. The truth is that there is a lot of suffering going around and yet most people don't decide to murder or abuse others and use their own suffering as an excuse to do so.

Look at it from the point of view of the people, its a society where this has never happened, any hint of their origins and the truth of where they are has been long since lost to time. Fact become stories, stories become wives tales, becomes myths and legends, before fading completly from the collective racial history of an entire race. 

Down through the generations it goes, every generation a little more is lost as those who knew the truth are unable to pass on the information to their children because of death/disease etc till nothing is left.


You look up to see the sky, something that has remained fixed point through all of living memory. And all of a sudden its gone. It would be of a scale like us on earth waking up one morning to find something insane like another planet stretching from horizon to horizon above us.

This is what I think you mean by angle. Now this doesn't seem to buckle the knot when using my boot, but the diameter, size, hardness etc. of the wood plank/cylindrical wood plank exploits that in the knot causing it to buckle and lose its integrity.

dnqio3a,"...This is embarrassing to know you came from r/fireemblem, I didn't think people would look through my post history and find me being a simpering fool because my illness got a stranglehold of me last night.

Well, now that you're here and while I debate if I want to keep this up or not... might as well reply.

I get what you're saying and I do agree. It's just that to us Borderlines, having a \"favorite person\" means more than it entails. To us with BPD, having an \"FP\" as we call them is... how do I put this? Basically, the FP is the most important person in our lives. We ignore their shortcomings and we're so starved for attention and affection we don't care if this FP is a bad person at all. Unfortunately, an ex friend of mine was an FP years ago and while they were, I had realized they were bad for me and I had to pull myself away as hard as it was. Till now, they're still angry I did it despite the fact I don't talk to them anymore. Losing an FP is black and white for us: if we lose them, that means they're a shitty person and how dare they fool us? While we're in the \"honeymoon\" phase, we legit think our FPs are capable of doing no wrong.

To put it in simple terms: we put them on a pedestal which proves to be detrimental to both us and our FP. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: if having an FP is so bad, why do we do it anyways? Why do we want to be someone's favorite too, in that case? For that, I have no clear answer. The best I can come up with is that we just want to be as important to someone else too. It isn't fair to us, in our minds, that we have people we idolize and would do anything for only for that person not to feel the same way. It makes us feel attention-starved more and it makes us feel we're not worthy of anyone's time.

It's fucked up thinking, I know, but we're Borderlines after all. Everyone on this sub is a Borderline and we understand each other which is why we all rant to each other here, because even our therapists are sick of our shit.

I went off on a tangent there.

Unfortunately, when we have an \"FP\", we become very clingy, very dependent, and... it's really a toxic relationship. At least for the people who don't want to be our FPs. Some people understand the way our stupid brains work while others are quick to block us or ghost us and call us hideous names for something we cannot control for the life of us.

You have points, you do, and I acknowledge you are right. Buying gifts and such is no way to make friends, and I acknowledge this. You are also right that I do not trust \"Person A\" in this hypothetical situation. To be frank, even though I have friends who care about me, there is always a doubt lurking in the back of my mind that they are actually Person C in this situation. This is because I, like a large majority of this sub, have been abandoned and used like we're nothing.

I apologize for this massive wall of text. There are days I'm better at controlling my BPD, and there are days when I cannot control it no matter how much I try. While I know it's silly to hope I could be someone's \"FP\", a part of me does continue to hope for it. It's just the way my brain is wired, I guess.",2,-0.9889

dnqio75,"So I have a long term success story. My mother has borderline personality disorder and spent my entire childhood vacillating between the extremes of every emotion, within a short time frame. It was horrible because I never knew what to expect and had to be constantly on guard. She would go from praising my intelligence to telling me I was a desperate whore worth nothing all while making me feel responsible for her emotions. She essentially gaslighted me my entire life and I still struggle with feeling confident in my own memories. There was other stuff too, sexual abuse at home but I have very few memories of that, thankfully, since what I do have is bad enough. Thanks to this I had horrible coping mechanisms. I have no idea how my husband put up with me for the first couple years. Eventually, I managed to escape my childhood horrors and realized I needed help because I wasn't ok and I wanted to be the best version of myself possible for my own daughter. So, I found a therapist I was comfortable with and put in the time and work to learn how to process what I lived through and cultivating positive coping mechanisms in addition to finding a combination of medicines to help me remain stable instead of teetering into depression and the more obsessive, controlling tendencies I get when stressed. It took several years to get to where I am now but I'm finally happy, steady, and comfortable with/proud of who I am. I even managed to forgive my mother for how she treated me. I know she has a problem and is miserable so I can understand WHY she does things but I will never have a relationship with her. I just refused to allow her to have any impact on my life anymore because she stole enough from me already, I'm not going to allow her to do it now that she's out of my life. Being angry and resentful wasn't hurting her at all (in fact, that allows her to be the victim, which she loves) but it was eating me up so I decided to let it go.

Can you detail out your experiences with \"publishing?\" I see a lot of comments in awe of this, frankly, trivial thing.

I know of many YA authors who have agents and publishers that will not touch anyone who is self-published, and contractually require them to abstain from doing so. If something was already self-published, it will never be picked up for major publication. Maybe in the early days where that was still an interesting rags to riches story, but I was surprised to find how vilified that process is when to me it sounds like the definition of proactivity.

I am assuming that you've essentially self-published your novel, and did not go through Big Publishing to do it, else you wouldn't be running your own AMA and would be linking to / referring to your publishers as required by contract.

Further, you spoke about carrying the novel \"through editing.\" Did you self-edit, or have an editor review? Especially with YA, an editor's role is aligned completely with a publisher because they will edit the story to increase target audience stickiness + product potential, so it isn't merely proofreading.

Any marketing or ad budget (besides word-of-mouth social like this AMA)?

Did you consult anyone regarding these issues? Were you aware of them? 

Or did you simply DIY the whole thing?

I'm interested to know as again the aspiring writers I work with all seem to have the same issue of self-publishing leading to success being a fairy tale pushed by those interested to profit from mass amounts of self-publishing, and for NYT bestseller levels you will either not find or see a cover-up regarding their self-publishing days.

The industry has changed a lot in recent years. Self-publishing is becoming bigger for first time authors as it is becoming harder and harder to traditionally publish with the decline of sales for physical books. I've found through going to conferences and asking publishers and agents specifically about this issue that many are changing their views to pick up authors whose self-published work sells well. All that said, I also may never go traditional. I enjoy having control over my novel and final say on everything regarding it. That's just my opinion. However, I believe that if I chose to go the traditional route with a publishing house that I wouldn't have an issue finding a publisher to pick up my novel if it sells well. 

As for editing I had a professional editor that I worked with for a year and a half on making sure this manuscript was the best it could be. Not all editors are aligned with publishers these days, and the editing the story to cater to a crowd is the opposite of what I wanted. Writing is my passion, I'm not in it for the money, and I'm going to stay true to my writing and my stories.

As for marketing I am fortunate enough to know a world-class marketer who is helping me market my novel. 

I consulted a lot of people and have been to several writing conferences where I have been able to ask the professionals these question so I did not go into this process blind. I was well informed about the flaws and issues that come with this process.

You did well to hire and editor and seek the help of that marketer, but you should definitely be prepared for an uphill battle.  That marketer is going to be your best friend, so definitely seek their advice as this continues.

I just wanted to let you know, from someone who self-published eight books and is currently trying to sneak into traditional publishing, that writing and releasing the book is much, much easier than the rest of the process.  Keep a strong hand on your social media, post every day, but mostly don't assume people will want to read your book or automatically respect you for self-publishing.  

In fact, it's the opposite.  Readers want any chance to be distracted away from your work, and it's up to you to make them care enough about you to read your book.  Writing YA makes that easier because you have a larger base that's easier to manage, but keeping up with your platform is still going to be the toughest part of your job.

dnqioi6,"The whole cast is multiracial. There are very few roles played by clearly white people, King George is an exception. Wiki says this...  
Casting diversity: Miranda said that the portrayal of Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and other white historical figures by black and Hispanic actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members. \"Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional\", he said. \"It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.\" He noted \"We're telling the story of old, dead white men but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.\"

The pro-immigration message of Hamilton is at the forefront, as the show revolves around the life of one of the Founding Fathers of America, Alexander Hamilton, and how he made his mark in American politics as an immigrant. Instead of being characterized as a white person, Alexander Hamilton's immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show, alongside with the virtue and prowess of Hamilton (\"by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter,\" described in the show's opening), in order to foster a positive image of immigrants. Alongside this, the casting of Black, Latino, and Asian American leads allowed audiences to literally view America as a nation of immigrants, with the intention of showing how irrelevant the Founding Fathers' whiteness is to their claim on the country. \"Hamilton is a story about America, and the most beautiful thing about it is... it's told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music,\" according to Renee Elise Goldberry, who played Angelica Schuyler. \"We have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don't necessarily think is our own.\" Miranda has stated that he is \"totally open\" to women playing the Founding Fathers. Casting for the British production is expected to feature predominantly black British artists.",1,0.9847

I get that burning bridges might need to happen, or at least letting the bridges stop being used. My biggest thing isn't necessarily being able to express myself around people I know right now, it's about how to not drive myself crazy.

Another thing is, how do I manage to balance the desire of being more open with the idea of maintaining some secrecy? Seems like those ideas are opposites and can't coexist in my mind.",1,0.9746

We tend to box God up by His characteristics. Some people think only on God's love. Others, His wisdom. Even others, His justice. Even others, His benevolence.

This is wrong to do. God is not just a being of infinite love. He is also a being of infinite hate towards evil. He is a being of justice. You can not separate God by one or two of His attributes. Just like you would not like people to misrepresent by only defining you by your hair color. 

So the question is, what is a good and just God supposed to do with an evil people like us?

You will say, \"Yeah, but why hell for ETERNITY? Why not temporal judgement. I am, after all, a finite being.\"

This is a question asked only by those with a small view of God and His holiness. An allegory would be to liken your crime of hitting me in public. What would happen to you? You might get arrested for a small bit. You might even get away with it depending on where we were at or who had seen it.

But if you had struck the President of the United States, how much greater would be your crime? How much greater the punishment? Why? Because the position of authority you just offended is much greater than mine.

In the same way, God's justice is infinite because His position of authority is infinite. Our crimes against Him are infinite.

Good news is, He is also a God of infinite love, (remember?) And Jesus substituted/represented on the cross all who would believe in Him and receive grace and forgiveness, for He suffered our judgement on our behalf.

Those who will not receive grace, but in their stubbornness continue to love their life of sin instead of turning to Christ; God is a God of justice.",0,0.9845

So I actually started my first draft on a type-writer that my grandmother had given me. When I was transferring it from there to word I realized that the story sucked, so I pulled out the pieces I liked and threw away what I didn't. What I was left with was the first half of the plot, and my main characters. From there I reshaped it, and rewrote about 75% of it. I didn't like the other one as much, and the ending wasn't true to the book. It wasn't too hard because it was never a job to me- I've always loved the story and the world I got to play in when writing it. For me it wasn't work so I didn't see the set-back in scrapping everything.",1,0.4504

B. Take away the garrison but add the ability to garrison a lord and their army, keep the replenishment bonus so that the lords army can function for a long period of time. Make it so that without a army the Arks are sitting ducks.

Traditional Chinese doctors value the existence of the life essence, which are anti-matter substance in our bodies. They are very,very important, as it is one of the basic components of your life! (It's funnny that Western doctors don't believe those simply because they could not detect it yet. ) 

When you carry out the process of reproduction, you give out your life essence (yin for girls) so it can be matched with the other half (yang for boys) to form a baby, along with sperm and eggs.  The more you do it for purpose outside of having children, the more life essence you waste.

And what happens when you waste too much of it? Well, you will age prematurely! (That's one reason why Western people ages earlier than Eastern people, since the culture in the East are more conservative than the West) And what's more, it will make you feel like a hollow stump without energy, and all problems and weird diseases can occur everywhere in your body, since the immunity system can't get their share of life essence, and therefore unable to make enough white blood cells to fight viruses and other invaders.

Starting off with the most important question: the original because the humour was so on point and the characters felt more real than whatever Teen Titans Go! Has going on right now. I adore the one I grew up with. 

Yes! I've always been a reader. I remember learning to read with my dad specifically when I was younger and his mother was an English teacher so she fostered the love of reading in me as a child. I attribute my love of literature and writing to her. She passed away two years ago this month and I miss her everyday. 

Favorite authors are Ray Bradbury, J.K. Rowling, Jane Austen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. 

To be honest I adore classics. My dad bought be a bunch for Christmas when I was 12 and I've been hooked ever since. I started writing about intergalactic travels though because I wanted to write worlds where I'm not bound by traditional rules that we have here on Earth. I wanted limitless possibilities and adventure.

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them \"imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.\"
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

They would basically set it and forget it.   This is not possible on Poloniex, Bittrex, or Kraken.  The more times these user are forced to log on, the more chance there is of catastrophe.

also (and this is key), harriers count on dealing their damage as...discreetly as possible.  if you challenge and pursue them directly (unless you're a medic), the fact that they're so woefully outgunned instantly transforms them from predators into prey.  so, yeah, realizing how weak their gun is is significant, because you might find more success challenging them directly rather than trying to flee.

The big thing is that it didn't feel optional because by the time you get to that point you've already played the game three times and the fourth is your final 'finish the game' run.

It even dumps you directly into Inferno when you talk to the characters after killing Diablo the same way that after killing Malachai it would open a portal to Cruel/Merciless. But Inferno was, from the first moment, ludicrously hard to the point where grinding white mobs for trash drops for weeks until you could kill skeleton king, to grind him for weeks to try and get strong enough for the next boss, etc, was completely normal. The final difficulty didn't feel optional any more than Nightmare/Hell did.

2. Bench responds well to frequency and GPP, especially for newer lifters. Try to bench 3 days per week and include some variants in there too - dips, push ups, incline, close grip, db press, etc. Even just general bodybuilding work for your upper body will be helpful. Just make sure you're doing enough rowing, curling and rear delt work to keep things like your elbows and shoulders happy.

3. Absolutely compete! If you can lift the bar and the collars to the legal standard of your chosen federation then get on in there. Powerlifters are a very supportive bunch. Don't make the mistake of waiting until you're \"competitive\". Meets are a great way to expose you to the sport, put some external pressure on your training and develop the competition skills required to help you perform when you are competitive.

Powered by Isotope-39, a gift from Heaven, it has the power to transform Things into Other Things (it's most commonly used to change humans into Others as a reward for extreme Party loyalty).  It can also do cool stuff like rearrange the city, which is built on a giant Rubik's Cube.

dnqip3e,"&gt;Views will go down because nobody will watch bad teams

Actually views have gone down a lot compared to what their previous peaks were.  You have less viewers for a longer amount of time with bo3.  It's not as important that the views might be about the same over time if they are chasing PEAK viewership.

I will watch a game of 2 \"bad\" teams, but I'm not gonna watch a single game in a bo3 with 2 bad teams.  Not everyone has the same viewing habits.  I mean, this gives me time to watch EU now too.

&gt;Cheese strats will hurt good teams

Part of being a good team is being adaptable.  If cheese strats work so well against good teams in bo1, maybe they're not that good?  Imo it's more annoying watching a good team smash a bo3 and helps level the playing field a bit if the \"good teams\" have to also prepare for cheese.",2,0.9471

dnqip3m,"This. I went the MBA route part time for 3 years and came out with a managing position and above average pay plus perks. The $100k degree will pay off in less than 4 years neglecting pay increase or bonuses. Another strong suggestion-work for the contractor building the projects. A PE will make you a project manager if you have any semblance of social skills. You'll use less of your engineering background, certainly, and the work environment is very demanding but the pay is substantially better than government and notably better than engineering firms.

Different branches of civil command significantly different pay. Water/environmental are probably near the lower end but move towards bridges or the oil industry and the pay can be double what W/E commands.",5,0.7823

dnqip3p,"~60 wr Mino in epic V so take my advice with a grain of salt

Initiate when:

- enemy team is out of position, ex. Clumped up (easier to be aoed, backline easily deleted since they cant run away fast enough, allows you the tank to cc them)
In low elo, if mage and mm like to be in front/ has shit positioning  attack right away and kill them- easy 5v3
-enemy low health, your team has higher health- usually a good move but must take into factor if your team is bad or good at teamfights because 4 good players can destroy 5 bad teamfighters
- outnumbering, if 2 enemies are at their top and bot lane, gank 5v3 by the time they get there their 3 teammates are dead

- team is higher leveled and more items- good to be agressive here as item/hero stats will give you the advantage 


Also if they are spread out, like 3 at lord and 2 at mid, gank lord side as quickly as possible. By the time their 2 teammates get there, they will suicide and their lord got stolen.

- also make sure if your teammates are following you
If you initiate but your teammates run away (low elo), then you end up dying while teammates call you noob, idiotic tank.

- run away if you feel your team will be wiped out and press retreat",9,-0.9818
